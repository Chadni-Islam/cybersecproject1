0, DNSpionage ,"  DNSpionage is the name of an HTTP/DNS espionage campaign targeting several Middle East countries and companies. This campaign uses fake job posting websites to deliver malicious RTF documents to the applicants.  The infection occurs when the user tries to open one of the malicious files, which contains an application form bundled with an obfuscated macro script. This macro acts as a dropper for an encoded executable file. It also creates a scheduled task to execute the malware every minute.  The malware then gathers system information and files, and will try to leak it using either HTTP or DNS tunneling. It can also act as an agent, interpreting a set of commands sent by the server to perform actions such as downloading additional scripts and utilites into the machine. The HTTP mode generates traffic to the domain 0ffice36o[.]com. Since the encoded commands are embedded in the domain name prefix, the DNS channel can be also used to send and receive the CnC.  We've added NIDS signatures and updated the following correlation rule as a result of DNSpionage activity: system compromise, malware, trojan infection.

1, Responder.py ,"  SpiderLabs Responder is a project freely available on GitHub that contains the logic to launch a rogue authentication server compatible with several Microsoft network protocols such as NTLM. It can be use to poison LLMNR, NetBios Name Service, and MDNS packets.  This NBT-NS/LLMNR Responder has been open for four years. During this time, it has extended its functionality, so it can act as a great variety of MS-oriented network nodes. This includes SMB/MSSQL/HTTPS/LDAP/FTP Authentication servers, DNS server, WPAD Proxy server, ICMP redirector, rogue DHCP and network analyzer.  We've added NIDS signatures and updated the following correlation rule as a result of NTLM Responder activity: exploitation & installation, malware infection, hacking tool.","four years, ","Microsoft, NTLM, LLMNR, NetBios Name Service, MDNS, SMB/MSSQL/HTTPS/LDAP/FTP Authentication, DNS, ICMP, NTLM Responder, ",,Responder.py % is project contains logic launch authentication server network protocols ,can be use poison packets 've added signatures updated following correlation rule result activity exploitation installation malware infection hacking tool ,Medium,,,3,
