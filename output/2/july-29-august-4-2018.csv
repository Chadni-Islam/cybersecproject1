0, Bisonal ,"  Bisonal malware has been seen in the wild since 2013, but it is still being leveraged by at least one malware group attacking Russia and several countries in Asia. The campaigns performed by this group are usually against military or defense industries. The attackers trick victims into clicking on an executable by changing the icon to one of a PDF file. Once the backdoor is installed, it has the ability to monitor the system as well as access to a shell. The communication with the C2 is encoded. We've updated the following correlation rule to detect Bisonal malware activity:  system compromise, malware infection, backdoor.
